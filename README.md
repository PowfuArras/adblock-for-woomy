# adblock-for-woomy

## Description
This Markdown document provides information about an adblocker script specifically designed for the website https://woomy.app/. The adblocker script has been modified to address issues caused by DrakoHyena's implementation, which caused the game to break when traditional adblockers were active. To ensure the script remains effective, the code has been obfuscated, making it challenging for DrakoHyena to patch the script every time an update is made.

## Note
It is important to disable your regular adblocker when using this script. If the script ever breaks, check back here. I might have released a patch

## Contact
If you have any questions or need further assistance, please reach out to me on Discord: @xskt.

## Intallation
1. Copy the contents of userscript.js
2. Paste the script into your favorite script manager (tampermonkey, greasemonkey, violentmonkey, etc)
3. Tada! Just make sure to enable it lol
