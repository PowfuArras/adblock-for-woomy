# adblock-for-woomy

## Description
An adblocker script specifically designed for the website https://woomy.app/. The adblocker script has been obfuscated to address issues caused by DrakoHyena's implementation, which caused the game to break when traditional adblockers were active. Additionally, the code being obfuscated helps ensure the script remains effective making it challenging for DrakoHyena to patch the script every time an update is made.

## Note
It is important to disable your regular adblocker when using this script. If the script ever breaks, check back here. I might have released a patch

## Intallation
1. Copy the contents of userscript.js
2. Paste the script into your favorite script manager (tampermonkey, greasemonkey, violentmonkey, etc)
3. Tada! Just make sure to enable it lol
